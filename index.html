            <p>I am a Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, previously from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Data Science. My interests include combining my strengths in Data Analytics and Visualization with my love of Basketball. </p>
            <p>The decision to transfer was not an easy one and took a lot of time and thought. After learning more about UNCâ€™s Statistics & Analytics program and talking to professors I decided transferring was in my best interest.</p>
            <p>In the future I hope to work for an NBA team utilizing my strengths on either the business or basketball side.</p>

            <p>This season, I had the opportunity to contribute to the success of the UNC Womenâ€™s Basketball team as their Basketball Analytics Assistant. I played a key role in the teamâ€™s achievements, including securing a top 14 ranking in the final AP poll, with a peak of 8th during week 17, and the most wins under the current head coach. The team also earned a program-best tournament seed in over a decade, hosted March Madness games for only the second time in history, and reached the Sweet 16 for the second time with this coaching staff. It has been rewarding to see how my work in analytics has supported the teamâ€™s growth and success.</p>
            <p>In my role, I oversee the management of a comprehensive practice database that tracks player stats, shot locations, and overall progress, ensuring all data is accurate and up to date. I generate custom visual analytics reports for coaches after each practice using a Shiny App, providing insights into player development and team performance to help drive adjustments. Additionally, I developed a custom Shiny App to analyze offensive set metrics, helping coaches make more informed decisions on play calls by comparing set effectiveness based on key metrics like shot quality, turnovers, and fouls. I also assist with personalized scouting reports for each game, offering actionable insights that align with the coaches' observations and strategy. These projects, along with the numerous miscellaneous reports that are completed when needed, assist our coaches to make the most well-informed decisions they can.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to intern with the Sacramento Kings as part of their Business Intelligence team. During my time there, I honed my skills in SQL, R, and Tableau while gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of an NBA team. I learned how data drives critical business decisions and how the organization operates behind the scenes. One of my key projects involved creating efficient, long-lasting dashboards in Tableau for the marketing department to evaluate the success of events at the Golden 1 Center. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of creating tools that not only provide immediate insights but also remain functional and relevant over time.</p>
            <p>In addition to dashboard creation, I also developed a logistic regression model in R to predict the likelihood of season ticket members retaining their memberships for the next season. I integrated this model into a Shiny app, providing an interactive tool for the team to use in their decision-making process. SQL played a crucial role in both projects, enabling me to manage and manipulate the data effectively. I want to thank everyone who helped me get this opportunity and the entire team at the Kings for making this experience so rewarding. I'm excited to apply the skills and knowledge I've gained to future opportunities in sports analytics and business intelligence.</p>

            <p>Spring of 2024 marked the beginning of an exciting journey for me as I stepped into the role of an analytics assistant with UMass baseball. Working closely with our cutting-edge software, <a href="https://www.trumedianetworks.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">TruMedia</a>, I was tasked with managing a myriad of statistics, visualizations, and video analyses.
