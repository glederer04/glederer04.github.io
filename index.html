            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Gregory Lederer â€” a junior at the <b>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</b> studying <b>Statistics & Analytics</b> with minors in <b>Data Science</b> <em>and</em> <b>Geography</b> (the second one kind of happened by accident, but Iâ€™m proud of it).</p>
            <p>Originally from Glen Mills, PA, and formerly at UMass Amherst, Iâ€™ve always been passionate about using data to better understand the game of basketball â€” and sports in general. I love digging into analytics, creating visualizations, and building tools that make insights easy to understand and actionable.</p>
            <p>This summer (2025), Iâ€™ll be interning in <b>Data Analytics</b> with the <b>Miami Heat</b>, where Iâ€™ll continue growing my skills and learning more about the inner workings of an NBA organization.</p>
            <p>Also worth knowing: Iâ€™m a huge Philadelphia Phillies fanâ€¦ but not an Eagles fan (NY Giants &gt;).</p>
            <p>In the long term, Iâ€™m working toward a career in the NBA â€” whether thatâ€™s on the basketball or business side â€” where I can combine my competitive mindset, creativity, and data-driven approach to help a team win.</p>

            <p>This season, I had the opportunity to contribute to the success of the UNC Womenâ€™s Basketball team as their Basketball Analytics Assistant. I played a key role in the teamâ€™s achievements, including securing a top 14 ranking in the final AP poll, with a peak of 8th during week 17, and the most wins under the current head coach. The team also earned a program-best tournament seed in over a decade, hosted March Madness games for only the second time in history, and reached the Sweet 16 for the second time with this coaching staff. It has been rewarding to see how my work in analytics has supported the teamâ€™s growth and success.</p>
            <p>In my role, I oversee the management of a comprehensive practice database that tracks player stats, shot locations, and overall progress, ensuring all data is accurate and up to date. I generate custom visual analytics reports for coaches after each practice using a Shiny App, providing insights into player development and team performance to help drive adjustments. Additionally, I developed a custom Shiny App to analyze offensive set metrics, helping coaches make more informed decisions on play calls by comparing set effectiveness based on key metrics like shot quality, turnovers, and fouls. I also assist with personalized scouting reports for each game, offering actionable insights that align with the coaches' observations and strategy. These projects, along with the numerous miscellaneous reports that are completed when needed, assist our coaches to make the most well-informed decisions they can.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2025, I had the opportunity to work in data analytics with the Miami HEAT, where I collaborated closely with 601 Analytics. A large portion of my work focused on improving internal documentation and workflows, which included designing a custom HTML-based site that organized all of our data pipelines, reports, models, and code. This involved developing a searchable navigation system, building interactive PDF viewers, and integrating team-based filters so staff could easily find and understand the resources they needed. The project was used across departments and will continue to serve as a long-term reference hub for the organization.</p>
            <p>In addition to documentation, I spent time working in SQL and Python to support our internal modeling projects, most notably contributing to an in-season attendance forecast model. I helped clean, structure, and analyze large event-level datasets that powered the model and collaborated with the team on how to best communicate results. Toward the end of the summer, I also co-led a presentation to the organization on increasing game viewership and engagement, which was selected as the winning intern project.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to intern with the Sacramento Kings as part of their Business Intelligence team. During my time there, I honed my skills in SQL, R, and Tableau while gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of an NBA team. I learned how data drives critical business decisions and how the organization operates behind the scenes. One of my key projects involved creating efficient, long-lasting dashboards in Tableau for the marketing department to evaluate the success of events at the Golden 1 Center. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of creating tools that not only provide immediate insights but also remain functional and relevant over time.</p>
            <p>In addition to dashboard creation, I also developed a logistic regression model in R to predict the likelihood of season ticket members retaining their memberships for the next season. I integrated this model into a Shiny app, providing an interactive tool for the team to use in their decision-making process. SQL played a crucial role in both projects, enabling me to manage and manipulate the data effectively. I want to thank everyone who helped me get this opportunity and the entire team at the Kings for making this experience so rewarding. I'm excited to apply the skills and knowledge I've gained to future opportunities in sports analytics and business intelligence.</p>
