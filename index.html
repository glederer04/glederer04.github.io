            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; text-decoration: underline;">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Sophomore Honors student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a double major in Mathematics, concentrating in Statistics & Data Science, and Sport Management. My interests include combining my strengths in Data Analytics and Visualization with my love for the game of Basketball.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; text-decoration: underline;">Experiences</h2>
            <h2>Student Manager - <a href="https://umassathletics.com/sports/mens-basketball" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">UMass Men's Basketball</a></h2>
            <p>As a student manager for the UMass Men's Basketball team since December of my freshman year, I've immersed myself in a dynamic role that seamlessly merges my love for basketball with my proficiency in data science. A significant part of my responsibilities involves developing and maintaining a user-friendly website using Shiny Apps in R, offering insightful visualizations of individual and team practice metrics. Beyond the digital realm, I dedicate over 30 hours per week to execute managerial duties, collaborating closely with coaches, staff, and fellow managers to ensure the smooth operation of practices and games throughout the season.</p>
            <p>My role extends beyond the traditional boundaries of a student manager. Leveraging my skills in R programming, Microsoft Excel, strategy, and statistics, I provide crucial analytics to coaches, staff, and players. Whether it's generating pregame and postgame reports or contributing to special projects, I find immense satisfaction in applying my data-driven insights to enhance player performance and overall team dynamics. This hands-on experience has not only enriched my academic journey but also solidified my passion for the intersection of sports management and data analytics.</p>

            <h2>Summer Associate - <a href="https://intellisportanalytics.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">IntelliSport Analytics</a></h2>
            <p>As a Summer Associate at IntelliSport Analytics following my freshman year, I delved into the dynamic realm of sports data analytics, contributing to the company's mission of providing sport industry leaders with actionable insights. Using mixed-method data analytics tools, I engaged in quantitative research and analysis to empower decision-makers with the information necessary for strategic choices. Throughout the summer, I presented findings and collaborated on a specific project, honing my skills in quantitative research, data analytics, and statistics.</p>
            <p>My time at IntelliSport Analytics was a pivotal experience that allowed me to apply classroom knowledge to real-world challenges within the sports industry. The opportunity to work on meaningful projects not only enhanced my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of the intersection between data and sports.</p>

            <h2>Events Intern - <a href="https://thetournament.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">The Basketball Tournament (TBT)</a></h2>
            <p>As an Events Intern for The Basketball Tournament (TBT) during the summer after my freshman year, I embraced a hybrid role that allowed me to contribute both remotely and in person. My responsibilities spanned various facets of event planning and execution, from managing online orders for product tracking and shipping to coordinating game-day operations in the high-energy atmosphere of competitive basketball.</p>
            <p>My hands-on involvement in the planning and execution of TBT provided valuable insights into the intricacies of organizing a major sporting event. Working closely with the team, I gained practical experience in managing logistics, handling online orders efficiently, and seamlessly executing game-day operations. The in-person component of my role took me to Philadelphia, where I contributed to the success of the semi-final and final games, adding a dynamic and unforgettable dimension to my internship experience.</p>

            <p>During the winter of my freshman year, I embarked on my first basketball-centric role as a Basketball Analyst for Full Court Analytics. This remote position involved providing high school basketball coaches with cutting-edge analytics, insights, and custom reports. My primary focus was breaking down game footage through in-depth analysis, offering valuable insights to coaches for strategic planning. This experience not only enhanced my strategic thinking and statistical skills but also fueled my passion for leveraging data to optimize performance in the dynamic world of basketball.</p>

            <h2>Data Analytics/Game Day Operations - <a href="https://www.pioneervalleytip-off.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">Pioneer Valley Tip-Off</a></h2>
            <p>During the winter of my freshman year, I played a pivotal role in the game day operations and data analytics for the Pioneer Valley Tip-Off, a student-run high school basketball event held on the UMass Amherst campus. Leveraging my skills in data analytics and statistics, I utilized software to provide teams with advanced in-game statistics. Collaborating with fellow students who shared similar interests, I actively supported all event teams throughout the weekend, contributing to the success of this engaging high school basketball showcase. This experience not only strengthened my leadership abilities but also allowed me to apply my analytical skills in a real-world, dynamic setting.</p>
