            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; text-decoration: underline;">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, previously from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Data Science. My interests include combining my strengths in Data Analytics and Visualization with my love of Basketball. </p>
            <p>The decision to transfer was not an easy one and took a lot of time and thought. After learning more about UNCâ€™s Statistics & Analytics program and talking to professors I decided transferring was in my best interest.</p>
            <p>In the future I hope to work for an NBA team utilizing my strengths on either the business or basketball side.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; text-decoration: underline;">Experiences</h2>
            <h2>Business Intelligence Intern - <a href="https://www.nba.com/kings/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">Sacramento Kings</a></h2>
            <p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern with the Sacramento Kings as part of their Business Intelligence team. During my time there, I honed my skills in SQL, R, and Tableau while gaining valuable insights into the inner workings of an NBA team. I learned how data drives critical business decisions and how the organization operates behind the scenes. One of my key projects involved creating efficient, long-lasting dashboards in Tableau for the marketing department to evaluate the success of events at the Golden 1 Center. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of creating tools that not only provide immediate insights but also remain functional and relevant over time.</p>
            <p>In addition to dashboard creation, I also developed a logistic regression model in R to predict the likelihood of season ticket members retaining their memberships for the next season. I integrated this model into a Shiny app, providing an interactive tool for the team to use in their decision-making process. SQL played a crucial role in both projects, enabling me to manage and manipulate the data effectively. I want to thank everyone who helped me get this opportunity and the entire team at the Kings for making this experience so rewarding. I'm excited to apply the skills and knowledge I've gained to future opportunities in sports analytics and business intelligence.</p>
            
            <h2>Analytics Assistant - <a href="https://umassathletics.com/sports/baseball" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">UMass Baseball</a></h2>
            <p>This spring marked the beginning of an exciting journey for me as I stepped into the role of an analytics assistant with UMass baseball. Working closely with our cutting-edge software, <a href="https://www.trumedianetworks.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">TruMedia</a>, I was tasked with managing a myriad of statistics, visualizations, and video analyses. My responsibilities extended to utilizing this wealth of data for team evaluation, scouting, and strategic planning. As someone deeply passionate about gaining hands-on experience in the realm of baseball analytics, I saw this opportunity as an ideal starting point. With a solid foundation in hard skills like R, Python, Tableau, and data science principles, I was confident in my ability to contribute effectively to the team's objectives. Moreover, I was eager to delve deeper into the strategic intricacies that define the game, leveraging my existing knowledge to enhance our approach.</p>
            
            <h2>Student Manager - <a href="https://umassathletics.com/sports/mens-basketball" style="text-decoration: none; color: #333; border-bottom: 1px dashed #333;" target="_blank">UMass Men's Basketball</a></h2>
            <p>As a student manager for the UMass Men's Basketball team, from December of my freshman year up until the end of the season my sophomore year, I immersed myself in a dynamic role that seamlessly merged my love for basketball with my proficiency in data science. A significant part of my responsibilities involved developing and maintaining a user-friendly website using Shiny Apps in R, offering insightful visualizations of individual and team practice metrics. Beyond the digital realm, I dedicated over 30 hours per week to executing managerial duties, collaborating closely with coaches, staff, and fellow managers to ensure the smooth operation of practices and games throughout the season.</p>
            <p>My role extended beyond the traditional boundaries of a student manager. Leveraging my skills in R programming, Microsoft Excel, strategy, and statistics, I provided crucial analytics to coaches, staff, and players. Whether it was generating pregame and postgame reports or contributing to special projects, I found immense satisfaction in applying my data-driven insights to enhance player performance and overall team dynamics. This hands-on experience not only enriched my academic journey but also solidified my passion for the intersection of sports management and data analytics.</p>

My responsibilities spanned various facets of event planning and execution, from managing online orders for product tracking and shipping to coordinating game-day operations in the high-energy atmosphere of competitive basketball.</p>
            <p>My hands-on involvement in the planning and execution of TBT provided valuable insights into the intricacies of organizing a major sporting event. Working closely with the team, I gained practical experience in managing logistics, handling online orders efficiently, and seamlessly executing game-day operations. The in-person component of my role took me to Philadelphia, where I contributed to the success of the semi-final and final games, adding a dynamic and unforgettable dimension to my internship experience.</p>
